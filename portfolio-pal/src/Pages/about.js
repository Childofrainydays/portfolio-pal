            <p>Hey, I'm Rayne- I like cars and I code.</p> 
            <p>There's just something great about seeing something come together as you put work into it. Maybe a bolt is lose, or something's throwing errors - but hey, it's fixable.</p> 
            <p>At first you pick up the wrong size wrench, or your code doesn't work - but the more you work on the project the more you learn.</p> 
            <p>Messing up your hair in the process is just part of the experience.</p>
            <break></break>
